# plexaria-drivers

This repository hosts JDBC driver releases used by PlexariaAuth for on-demand downloads.
I could use direct downloads for automatic driver updates, but unfortunately under unclear circumstances the plugin does not behave correctly, so I have to maintain this repository and update the drivers here. (Hopefully this is a temporary solution.)
